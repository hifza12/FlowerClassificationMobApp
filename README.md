## Flower Classification Mobile App Deployment Custom-TensorFlow-Model
This is a complete project that covers the development of a deep learning model for flower classification, Learn how to code your own neural network in Python, then deploy it in an Image Classification App using TensorFlow Lite, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment on a mobile app. The goal of the project is to accurately classify images of flowers into their corresponding species using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, and to make this model accessible to end-users through a mobile app interface.

The project includes code for data preprocessing, model training and evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras, and deployment of the trained model to a mobile app built with Flutter. The app allows users to take pictures of flowers, which are then classified using the trained model, and the corresponding species information is displayed on the app's user interface.

This project showcases the end-to-end workflow of developing a deep learning model for image classification, and demonstrates how the model can be deployed and integrated into a mobile app to make it accessible to end-users.
